# PacHead

Description:
Use of JavaScript to dynamically manipulate the DOM randomly placing and moving the Pac-Man heads around in a pre-determined area.
I also implement a factory function to add more heads with the click of a button.

How to Run:
Load page, click the "Add PacMan" button then click the "Start Game" to begin movement.
"Add Pac-Man" button will continue to add PacMen at any time for an indefinite number of times. 
Clicking on the "Start Game" button more than once will increase the movement speed.

Roadmap:
Future work will include functions to reset the game, add ghosts and manipulate movement direction of a single PacMan using the arrow keys.
